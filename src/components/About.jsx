        As a software developer with expertise in web development, machine
        learning, and competitive coding, I am always eager to learn and expand
        my knowledge in the field. I thrive in collaborative environments that
        value creativity and technical excellence, and I have worked on projects
        ranging from developing web applications to building and training
        machine learning models. My problem-solving skills are well-honed,
        thanks to my experience in competitive coding and LeetCode. I enjoy
        breaking down complex problems into manageable parts, and finding
        elegant solutions that are both efficient and effective. I am committed
        to staying up-to-date with the latest technologies and industry trends,
        and I am constantly seeking out new challenges and opportunities to grow
        as a developer. With a passion for innovation and a dedication to
        quality, I am excited to bring my skills and enthusiasm to any project.
